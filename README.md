# Blender to Gazebo

Translates and sends models into Gazebo with the right coordinates

## About this script

This is a simple script to convert Blender's object coordinates to Gazebo. It is currently able to run from Blender's scripting UI.

## Disclaimer

One of my first few scripting projects.
Written to practice scripting, the Python syntax and to automate my work.

## How to use
You have to currently select the object to get the coordinates. Copy it into your Gazebo's SDF.

## To-do's

* Multiple test of the script might still be needed.
* Simplify and make the code look pretty.
* Get this script up and running into Blender with a UI button.
* Automate it further so that it auto-fills in Gazebo's SDF.
