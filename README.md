# Blender to Gazebo

Translate the coordinates of a mesh in Blender into Gazebo.

## About this script

This is a simple script to convert Blender's object coordinates to Gazebo.
It's currently written in Python and only able to run in the console/API.

## Disclaimer

This is my first time writing a script so it's pretty lengthy.
I wrote this to practice the Python syntax and automate my work.

## How to use
Follow the instructions and copy the translated coordinates into Gazebo's SDF.

## To-do's

* Multiple test of the script is needed.
* Simplify and make the code look pretty.
* Get this script up and running into Blender with a "copy" button.
* Automate it further so that it auto-fills in Gazebo's SDF.
